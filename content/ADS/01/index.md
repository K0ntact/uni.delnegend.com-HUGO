# Obejctives
Course objectives:
- Provide basic knowledge about algorithms and data structures.
Be able to choose appropriate data structures for a specific problem.
- Approach different algorithms and solve a problem in informatics.

Why study Algorithms?
- Many problems in informatics can be solved by using a computer.
  - want it to go faster? process more data?
  - want it to do something that would otherwise be impossible?
- Technology improves many aspects but
  - might be costly
  - good algorithmic design can do much better and cheaper
  - super-computers cannot handle bad algorithms
- Data structure can make the algorithms much simpler, easier to maintain, and often faster
