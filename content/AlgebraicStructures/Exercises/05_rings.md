# Exercise 0
Prove the properties in Proposition 1

# Exercise 1
Which of the following sets are rings with respect to the usual operations of addition and multiplication?
- $7\mathbb{Z}$
- $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) = \{a + b\sqrt{2}, a, b \in \mathbb{Q}\}$

# Exercise 2
Let $R$ be a ring. Suppose $a^2 = a$ for every $a \in R$. Prove that $R$ is a commutative ring.

# Exercise 3
If $R$ is a ring with the identity element $1$ and $\phi$ is a homomorphism of $R$ onto $R'$, then prove that $\phi(1)$ is the identity element of $R'$.

# Exercise 4
If $R$ is a ring, let $Z(R) = \{x \in R|xy = yx, \forall y \in R\}$. Prove that $Z(R)$ is a subring of $R$.

# Exercise 5
An element $x$ of a ring $R$ is called nilpotent if some power is zero. Prove that if $x$ is nilpotent, then $1 + x$ is a unit (an unit in a ring is any element $u$ that has an inverse element $v$ in the multiplicative monoid of $R$ such that $uv = vu = 1_R$)

# Exercise 6
Prove that if $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$ are both ring isomorphisms, then so is their composition $(g \circ f): A \to C$.
