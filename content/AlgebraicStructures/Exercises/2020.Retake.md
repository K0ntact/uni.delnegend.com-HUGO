# Code 1

## Question 1
Solve the following linear equation system where $x,y \in \mathbb{Z}_11$:

$$\begin{aligned}
2x + 4y \equiv 3 \pmod{11} \\\
3x - 7y \equiv 3 \pmod{11}
\end{aligned}$$

Specify your algebra development to justify your answer.

## Question 2
Find an example of a cyclic group $U \subset \mathbb{Z}_{11}$. Justify the generator of the cyclic group.

## Question 3
Using induction to prove that the following statement is true:
{{%center%}}
$a^2 - 1$ is divisible by 8 for all odd and positive integers of a.
{{%/center%}}

## Question 4
A binary operation $o$ is defined as following:
$$a \ o \ b = a + 2b - 1$$
Is the binary **commutative? associative?** Justify your answer.

# Code 2

## Question 1
Solve the following linear equation system where $x,y \in \mathbb{Z}_{11}$:

$$\begin{aligned}
2x + 8y \equiv 3 \pmod{11} \\\
3x - 7y \equiv 10 \pmod{11}
\end{aligned}$$

Specify your algebra development to justify your answer.

## Question 2
Find an example of a cyclic group $U \subset \mathbb{Z}_13$. Justify the generator of the cyclic group.

## Question 3
Using induction to prove that the following statement is true for all positive integers $n$:

$$\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{(n+1)n^2}{4}$$

## Question 4
A function $f$ is defined by $f$: $\mathbb{Z}_8 \to \mathbb{Z}_11$

$$f(x) = 3x (mod 12)$$

Is the function **homomorphic? isomorphic?** Justify your answer.
