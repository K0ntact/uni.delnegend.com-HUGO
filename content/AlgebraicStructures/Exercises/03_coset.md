# Exercise 1
List the left and right cosets of the subgroup in each of the following:
- $\langle 8 \rangle$ in $\mathbb{Z}_24$
- $\langle 3 \rangle$ in U(8)$

# Exercise 2
Suppose that $g^n = e$, where $g$ is the generator of $G$. Show that the order of $G$ divides $n$.

# Exercise 3
Let $H = \text{\\{} 0, \pm 3, \pm 6, \pm 9, \ldots \text{\\}}$. Find all the left cosets of $H$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. Decide whether or not the following cosets of $H$ are the same.
- $11 + H$ and $17 + H$
- $-1 + H$ and $5 + H$
- $7 + H$ and $23 + H$

# Exercise 4
Suppose that $G$ is generated by $a$ has order 15. Find all of the left cosets of $\langle a^5 \rangle$ in $\langle a \rangle$.

# Exercise 5
Let $G$ be a group of order 60. What are the possible orders for the subgroups of $G$?
