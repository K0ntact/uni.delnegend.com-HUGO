# Exercise 0
Which relation is NOT a function?
$$\text{\\{} (1,-5), (3, 1), (-5, 4), (4,-2) \text{\\}}$$
$$\text{\\{} (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 8) \text{\\}}$$
$$\text{\\{} (1,-5), (-1, 6), (1, 5), (6,-3) \text{\\}}$$
$$\text{\\{} (3,-2), (5,-6), (7, 7), (8, 8) \text{\\}}$$

# Exercise 1
Which of the following relations $f : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ define a mapping? In each case, supply a reason why $f$ is or is not a mapping.
$$f(p/q) = \frac{p + 1}{p - 2}$$
$$f(p/q) = \frac{p}{p + q}$$

# Exercise 2
Determine which of the following functions are one-to-one and which are onto. If the function is not onto, determine its range.
$$f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \text{ defined by } f(x) = e^x$$
$$f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \text{ defined by } f(n) = n^2 + 5$$
$$f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \text{ defined by } f(x) = \sin x$$
$$f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \text{ defined by } f(x) = |x| + 2$$

# Exercise 3
Find the inverse of the following functions:
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x + 7$$
$$f(x) = (x - 2)^3 + 1$$
$$f(x) = \frac{1 + 2x}{7 + x}$$

# Exercise 4
Suppose that $f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3$ and $g(x) = \sqrt{x + 1}$. Determine the domain of $f + g$, $f - g$, $f g$, and $f / g$.

# Exercise 5
Define a function on real numbers by
$$f(x) = \frac{x + 1}{x - 1}$$
What are the domain and range of $f$? What is the inverse of $f$? Compute $f \circ f^{-1}$ and $f^{-1} \circ f$.

# Exercise 6
What is the inverse of $f(x) = \ln \left( \frac{e^x}{e^{x-1}} \right)$? What is the domain of $f^{-1}$?
