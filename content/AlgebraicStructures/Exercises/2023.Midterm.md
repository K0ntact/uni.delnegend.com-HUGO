# Problem 1
The Fibonacci numbers are
$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...$$
We can define them inductively by $f_1 = 1$, $f_2 = 2$ and $f_{n+2} = f_{n+1} + f_n$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Using induction, prove that $f_{2n} = f_1 + f_3 + f_5 + \cdots + f_{2n-1}$ for all $n \geq 1$.

- Step 1: let $n = 1$. Then $f_{2n} = f_1 + f_3 = 1 + 3 = 4$.
- Step 2: assume that $f_{2k} = f_1 + f_3 + f_5 + \cdots + f_{2k-1}$ for all $k \geq 1$.

# Problem 2
Find the inverse function $f^{-1}$ of the following function:
$$f(x) = \sqrt{x^3+7}$$
Determine the function's domain and range when $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Calculate the Cartesian product between $f^{\circ}f^{-1}$ and $f^{-1}f^{\circ}$. Justify your answer.

# Problem 3
Let $G = \text{\\{} x^2, \text{for all } x \in \mathbb{R} \text{\\}}$.
1. Is $(G, +)$ a group? Justify your answer.
2. Is $(G, \cdot)$ a group? Justify your answer.
