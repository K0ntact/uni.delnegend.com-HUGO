# Problem 1
- Let $G = \{ x^3, \text{ for all } x \in \mathbb{R} \}$. Is $(G, +)$ a group? Justify your answer.
- Is $(G, +, \cdot)$ a ring? Justify your answer.

# Problem 2
Let $R$ be a ring and a mapping $\phi: R \to R$ be a ring homomorphism. Prove that:
- $\phi(-r) = -\phi(r)$
- $\phi(r^k) = \phi(r)^k$, for all $k, r \in R$.

# Problem 3
Using induction to prove that $3^n > n^2$ for all natural numbers $n$.

# Problem 4
Solve the following linear system:

$$\begin{cases}
4x-3y+6z \equiv 5 (mod 9) \\\
3x+4y-z \equiv 3 (mod 9) \\\
5x+3y+2z \equiv 2 (mod 9)
\end{cases}$$
