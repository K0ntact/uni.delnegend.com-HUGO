# Problem 1
Using induction to prove that $n^3 + 2n$ is divisible by 3 for all positive integers $n$.

{{<expand "Solution">}}
- Step 1: let $n = 1$. Then $1^3 + 2 = 3 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$.
- Step 2: assume that $n = k$ is true, then $k^3 + 2k \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$.
- Step 3: consider $n = k + 1$
  - $(k + 1)^3 + 2(k + 1)$
  - $k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1 + 2k + 2$
  - $(k^3 + 2k) + 3(k^2 + k + 1)$

# Problem 2
Show that the function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^*$ is defined by $f(x) = ln(x)$. Is the function injective? surjective? Justify your answer.

# Problem 3
Solving the following linear system with $x,y \in \mathbb{Z}_11$:

$$\begin{aligned}
4x + 5y \equiv 3 \pmod{11} \\\
3x + 4y \equiv 3 \pmod{11}
\end{aligned}$$

Specify your algebra development to justify your answer.

# Problem 4
We suppose $\mathbb{G} = (\mathbb{R}^*, \circ)$ where the binary operation $\circ$ between $a, b \in \mathbb{G}$ and $a \circ b = |a.b|$. Is $\mathbb{G}$ a group under $\circ$? Justify your answer.
