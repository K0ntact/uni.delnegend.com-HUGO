# Exercise 1
Show that the following maps are group homomorphisms and compute their kernels.
1. $f: (\mathbb{R}^*, .) \to (\mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}, .)$ given by
$$f(x) = \begin{pmatrix} x & 0 \\\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

2. $f: (\mathbb{R}, +) \to (\mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}, .)$ given by
$$f(x) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & x \\\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

# Exercise 2
Let $G = \mathbb{R}\{âˆ’1\}$ and define a binary operation $\star$ on $G$ by:
$$a \star b = a + b + ab$$
Prove that $G$ is a group under this operation. Show that $(G, \star)$ is isomorphic

# Exercise 3
Determine whether the mappings defined from $G$ to $H$ are homomorphic/isomorphic and the kernel:
- $G, H$ are the group of non-zero real numbers $(\mathbb{R}^*, .)$ under multiplication and $\phi(x) = x^2$ for all $x \in G$
- $G, H$ are the group of non-zero real numbers $(\mathbb{R}^*, .)$ under multiplication and $\phi(x) = 2x$ for all $x \in G$
- $G$ and $H$ are groups of $(\mathbb{R}, +)$, $\phi(x) = x + 1$ for all $x \in G$

# Exercise 4
Let G be a group and define a map $f: G \to G$ by $f(a) = a^2$ for each $a \in G$. Then prove that $G$ is an abelian group if and only if the map $f$ is a group homomorphism.

# Exercise 5
Let G be a group. Prove that the mapping $\phi(g) = g^{-1}$ for all $g \in G$ is an automorphism if and only if G is abelian.

# Exercise 6
- If $\phi: G \to H$ is a group homomorphism and $G$ is abelian, prove that $\phi(G)$ is also abelian.
- If $\phi: G \to H$ is a group homomorphism and $G$ is cyclic, prove that $\phi(G)$ is also cyclic.
