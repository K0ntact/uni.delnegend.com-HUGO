# Exercise 1
Find all the cyclic subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_7$.

# Exercise 2
Let G be a cyclic group of order 6. How many of its elements generate G? Same question for the cyclic groups of order 5, 8, and 10.

# Exercise 3
Determine whether G is cyclic: $G = \mathbb{Z}_{7}^{\ast}, G = \mathbb{Z} _{12}^{\ast}$

# Exercise 4
- Find subgroup generated by 5 in $U(18) \cap \mathbb{Z}_{18}$
- Find subgroup generated by 3 in $U(20) \cap \mathbb{Z}_{20}$

# Exercise 5
Let $G = \mathbb{Z}_{20}^{\ast}$ be the group of invertible elements in $\mathbb{Z} _{20}$. Find two subgroups of order 4 in $G$, one that is cyclic and one that is not cyclic.

# Exercise 6
Show that if $G = \langle a \rangle$ is a cyclic group and $b \in G$ an element such that $a = bk$ for an integer $k$, then $b$ is a generator for $G$.
