# Exercise 1
The independent random variables X and Y each have normal distributions. The means of X and Y are 8 and 14 respectively, and the variances are 7 and 16, respectively. Find the following probabilities, giving your answers correct to 3 significant figures.

a. $P(X < 10)$\
b. $P(X < ̄10)$, where X ̄is the mean of a sample 3 independent observations of X.
c. $P(X < Y)$\
d. $P (2X > Y1 +Y2 +Y3)$, where $Y1$, $Y2$ and $Y3$ are 3 independent observations of Y.
