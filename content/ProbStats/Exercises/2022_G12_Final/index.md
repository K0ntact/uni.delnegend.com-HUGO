# Question 1
Given that $P(A) = 0.7, P(B) = 0.5$ and $P(A|B) = 0.8$. Find
- $P(A \cap B)$
- $P(A \cup B)$
- $P(B^c | A)$

# Question 2
A box contains 3 red balls and 5 blue balls. One ball is taken at random from the box and not replaced. A yellow ball is then put into the box. A second ball is now taken at random from the box.
- Complete the tree diagram to show all the outcomes and the probability for each branch.
- Find the probability that the 2 balls taken are the same color.
- Find the probability that the first ball taken is red, given that the second ball taken is blue.

# Question 3
An office block has a lift that can carry maximum permitted load of $500$ kg. It is known that the weight of men and women using the lift can be modeled by normal distribution. Then men's weight have mean $80$ kg and standard deviation $12$ kg. The women's weight have mean $56$ kg and standard deviation $6$ kg.\
On one occasion, 3 men and 4 women enter the lift. Calculate the probability that\
a. their total weight doesn't exceed the maximum permitted load.\
b. the total weight of the 3 men exceeds that of the 4 women.

# Question 4
Alice goes to the bank to make a withdrawal, and is equally likely to find 0 or 1 customer ahead of her. To service time of the customer ahead, if present, is exponentially distributed with parameter $\lamda$. What is the CDF of Alice's waiting time?
