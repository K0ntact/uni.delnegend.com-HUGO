- The Bilateral project for Education and Training based on Inter-governmental Agreement between Vietnam and France:
- "Establishment and Development of University for Science and Technology of Ha Noi"
## Bologna Process
- The Bologna Process is an intergovernmental higher education reform process that includes 49 European countries and a number of European organizations, including EUA. Its main purpose is to enhance the quality and recognition of European higher education systems and to improve the conditions for exchange and collaboration within Europe, as well as internationally.
- Launched in 1998-1999, the Bologna Process established goals for reform in the participating countries, such as the three-cycle degree structure (bachelor, master’s, doctorate), and adopted shared c-bluetruments, such as the European Credits Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) and the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (ESG).

**Output A: Effective Management and Governance System for the USTH**.
- Output A will assist in the development and implementation of the rigorous management and governance systems, capacity building programs for USTH senior managers and governors, university management and administrative systems and student services.

**Output B: Systems to Promote High Quality and Relevance in Academic Programs at USTH Developed and Implemented.**

Output B will establish and support the operation of a number of centers within the USTH that will promote high quality and relevance in academic programs at the USTH:
- <c-blue>Center for teaching and learning excellence</c-blue>. This will prepare graduate students to be university teachers and improve the teaching and curriculum development competencies of existing teachers.
- <c-blue>Center for quality assurance</c-blue>. This will embed a permanent internal quality assurance management service for USTH management and academic staff by, among other things, establishing a quality assurance framework and c-bluetitutionalizing the use of peer review and other strategies.
- <c-blue>Center for research support</c-blue>. The center will provide USTH staff with high-level support in designing and publishing their research, applying for grants, and providing training in research strategies to postgraduate students.
- <c-blue>Center for industry engagement</c-blue>. The center will be responsible for building links with industry and other potential users of USTH’s knowledge, expertise, and technologies. It will support researchers to establish industry links, develop joint research programs and contract research, and facilitate student placements, staff exchanges, and joint funding of infrastructure and services.
- <c-blue>Center for laboratory management</c-blue>. The center will develop a centralized workshop system for the maintenance and repair of USTH’s scientific laboratories and build the capacity of technical staff to sustain an international standard science and technology university.

**Output C: Physical Facilities at University of Science and Technology of Hanoi Constructed and Outfitted.**

- Output 3 will support the design, construction, and outfitting of the USTH physical facilities at the HHTP to support the university’s initial design capacity of 5,000 students. This will include site preparation, and design and construction of teaching spaces, research laboratories, dormitories, student leisure facilities, administration buildings, infrastructure, and provision of furniture, fittings, and equipment. Construction will use a design–bid–build approach.

**Output D: Effective Project Management and Implementation.**

- Output 4 will support the establishment of systems and staff capacity required for effective project management and implementation. Procurement for the construction of the campus under output 3 will be managed by the central project management unit (PMU-USTH), while the university implementation unit (UIU) will manage the implementation of USTH’s development (Outputs 1 and 2). The PMU-USTH will manage the development and implementation of a project monitoring and evaluation system, including preparation of required plans, data systems, and baseline studies.

# 3. Disaster Prevention Project in Vietnam
Disaster prevention through mangrove afforestation Contributing to protection of the Earth’s environment

Mangroves, which grow in marshy places, are called a ‘green wall’, protecting people from natural disasters such as typhoons and tsunami. The Japanese Red Cross Society (JRCS), has worked with the Vietnam Red Cross Society (VRCS), since 1997 to promote the afforestation of mangroves and other plants and on various environmental protection activities, covering about 10,408 hectares, which is equal to about 2226 Tokyo Domes. These forests are estimated to absorb about 16.3 million tons of greenhouse gas and thus contribute to the prevention of global warming.

‘We have come to live safely.’‘Mangrove’ is the general term for various types of plants growing in brackish (a mixture of fresh and salt) water. Mangrove forests were once numerous in Vietnam due to its rich environment. But war, deforestation, and shrimp farming have reduced the number by half. As a result, damage due to typhoons and tidal conditions has grown year by year, gravely affecting the lives of local people and their crops.
A disaster prevention project promoting mangrove afforestation was launched by the JRCS and VRCS to address this problem. Afforestation is carried out by hand of local people, and a wide range of activities aimed at forest protection and fire prevention enlightenment by local volunteers have been undertaken.

Hoan Ruon, vice chairman of the Red Cross branch in Hai Phong City, which is one of the project targets, looked back at the fruits of these activities over the past 20 years and said, ‘Although it has been very hard to attract volunteers, all of the members enthusiastically tackled their assignments. As a result, they have contributed to a reduction in climate change and the disasters it brings.’

Bui An Bien in Thai Binh province, who took part in the afforestation activities from the beginning of the project, said in joy, ‘Afforestation led to a safe life. Mangroves are a good environment for fish and other types of seafood, so we could start aquafarming.

Mangrove afforestation in Vietnam has been supported by the JRCS for 20 years. The initial target was six northern provinces. It has since been enlarged to ten provinces. The VRCS makes a strong effort to cooperate with the government to promote future support from the government.
