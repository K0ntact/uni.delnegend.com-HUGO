# 2. Origin and etymology of the word "project"
- The word *project* comes from the Latin word *projectum* from the Latin verb *proicere*, "before an action" which in turn comes from *pro-*, which denotes precedence, something that comes before something else in time (paralleling the Greek πρό) and *iacere*, "to do". The word "project" thus originally meant "before an action".
- When the English language initially adopted the word, it referred to a plan of something, not to the act of actually carrying this plan out. Something performed in accordance with a project became known as an "object". Every project has certain phases of development.
