# 1. Based on the fundamentals: term
## Long term (Years)
- Broad Goals (A company’s large scale objectives. I.E; Improve ROI, Increase Shareholder value, Gain market share etc…)
- Setting global business or strategic goals such as your release criteria, workflow setup and lifecycle?
- Selecting and assigning which resources are allocated to which projects (What team resources can I allocate? What can I afford to dedicate to this project?)

## Short term (Months)
- Specific Objectives (Hitting Milestones and Release Dates-Micromanaging the day to day - goals and activities, focusing on execution.
- People: Assigning individuals or teams with domain expertise to specific actions.

# 2. Based on the fundamentals: type
## Strategic project
- A strategic project has a primary goal of gaining the competitive advantage by focusing on the organization's overall direction.

## Tactical project
- These are projects that have one operational goal, which probably does not entail contributions by most employees within the organization. In these projects, meeting a tactical goal on time and within budget are key considerations.
---
Concepts and meaning should be differentiated:
- Goal: is an achievable that is generally board and longer term.
- Aim: what you hope to get and you want to do this.
- Purpose: the reason on one aim to achieve a goal.
- Object: shorter term and defines.
- Target: the exact results of what you want to get.

# 3. According to the source of fund
- <c-blue>Private sector project</c-blue>: the private sector bodies are responsible for the development and sponsor of the project. Examples: RP complex, Kathmandu mail, apartment complex, etc.
- <c-blue>Government sector project</c-blue>: in developing country government is the major sponsor of projects. These are the basis of government developing plans. Examples: road construction, school, health,...
- <c-blue>Grant project</c-blue>: investment in grant projects is not repaid by the government to the donor agencies.
- <c-blue>Loan project</c-blue>: investment in loan projects is repaid by the government to the donor agencies.

# 4. According to foreign aided project
- <c-blue>Joint venture project</c-blue>: the project is funded through the collaboration of foreign and local investors. They are based on ownership sharing. Also, they involve transferring of capital, technology, management. Example: Maruti-Suzuki.
- <c-blue>Bilateral project</c-blue>: the project is funded from the financial resources of the friendly donor country. Examples: JICA, KOICA.
- <c-blue>Multilateral project</c-blue>: This project is funded from the financial resources of multilateral agencies such as World Bank and Asian development bank. They are generally funded through loans. All UN agencies are multilateral.

# 5. According to technique

    - It cannot be applied for the long run.
    - No possibility of improving skills.
    - Low capital formation.
- <c-red>Capital intensive project</c-red>: This project is technology based. Technology represented by machinery and computerization is extensively used for implementation of the project.
  - <c-red>Advantages</c-red>
    - Applied for the long run.
    - Technology transfer.
    - Ease in capital formation.
  - <c-red>Disadvantages</c-red>
    - Required huge amount of capital.
    - Imbalance distribution of income in society.
    - Centralization.

# 6. According to function
## Disaster prevention projects
It is not feasible to formulate universally acceptable definition of disaster prevention project that will satisfy all practitioners, but common and agreed upon definitions must be formulated in the various fields and areas concerned with disasters and where there exit reconcilable, common sets of objective.
- Example: Disaster prevention project for sustainable project.

## Development projects
Community Development project

### Abstract
The development objective of the Community Development Project is to establish an effective and sustainable instrument to improve the living conditions and the economic status of disadvantaged communities.

### 2 main project components.
- The first component focuses on social and infrastructure development and provides sub-project grants for:
  - Carrying out social assessments and designing programs of sub-projects
  - Implementing sub-projects consisting of:
    - improving access to basic education, health, and social services by rehabilitating and upgrading schools and health, youth, cultural, and recreation centers and facilities in poor areas
    - carrying out programs for revolving school textbooks, literacy, and primary health care
    - improving access to specialized social services to satisfy the needs of vulnerable groups at risk
    - developing basic rural infrastructure activities such as community potable water and small drainage and irrigation schemes
    - enhancing environmental protection initiatives such as reforestation and natural resource and cultural heritage preservation.
- The second component focuses on income enhancement by funding capacity building activities to support:
  - micro and small entrepreneurs and nongovernmental organizations providing credit to target beneficiary groups
  - women, youth, and disabled people to provide them with demand-driven specialized skills that will help them increase income and business opportunities

Example
- <c-blue>Official development assistance (ODA)</c-blue>: a term coined by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to measure aid. The DAC first used the term in 1969. It is widely used as an indicator of international aid flow. It includes some loans.
- <c-blue>Definition</c-blue>: flows of official financing administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective, and which are concessional in character with a grant element of at least 25 percent (**using a fixed 10 percent rate of discount**). By convention, ODA flows comprise contributions of donor government agencies, at all levels, to developing countries (“bilateral ODA”) and to multilateral institutions. ODA receipts comprise disbursements by bilateral donors and multilateral institutions.

In other words, ODA needs to contain the three elements:
  - Undertaken by the official sector (official agencies, including state and local  governments, or their executive agencies)  with promotion of economic development and welfare as the main objective; and at concessional financial terms (if a loan, having a grant element of at least 25 per cent).

This definition is used to exclude development aid from the two other categories of aid from DAC members:
  - Official Aid (OA): flows which meet conditions of eligibility for inclusion in Official Development Assistance (ODA), other than the fact that the recipients are on Part II of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) List of Aid Recipients.
  - Other Official Flows (OOF): Transactions by the official sector with countries on the List of Aid Recipients which do not meet the conditions for eligibility as Official Development Assistance or Official Aid, either because they are not primarily aimed at development, or because they have a grant element of less than 25 per cent.

NGOs project definition
- A non-governmental organization (NGO) is a non-profit, citizen-based group that functions independently of government. NGOs, sometimes called civil societies, are organized on community, national and international levels to serve specific social or political purposes, and are cooperative, rather than commercial, in nature.
- Examples of NGOs include those that support human rights, advocate for improved health or encourage political participation. Two broad groups of NGOs are identified by the World Bank: operational NGOs, which focus on development projects; and advocacy NGOs, which are organized to promote particular causes. Certain NGOs may fall under both categories simultaneously.
- While the term "NGO" has various interpretations, it is generally accepted to include private organizations that operate without government control and that are non-profit and non-criminal. Other definitions further clarify NGOs as associations that are non-religious and non-military.
Some NGOs rely primarily on volunteers, while others support a paid staff. As non-profits, NGOs rely on a variety of sources for funding, including membership dues, private donations, the sale of goods and services, and grants. Despite their independence from government, some NGOs rely significantly on government funding.
- **Large NGOs may have budgets in the millions or billions of dollars.**

Examples
- If a donor country accords a grant or a concessional loan to Afghanistan it is classified as ODA, because it is on the Part I list.
- If a donor country accords a grant or a concessional loan to Bahrain it is classified as OA, because it is on the Part II list.
- If a donor country gives military assistance to any other country or territory it is classified as OOF, because it is not aimed at development.
- A recent OECD DAC Communique has seen the donor community update the definition of ODA to better reflect the Sustainable Development Goals.
  - ODA, DAC; OECD; OA: OOF\
    Communiqe: an official statement or Report, especially to newspapers

Countries by development aid given:

ODA volumes may be measured absolutely, by the amount transferred, or relatively, as a proportion of the donor country's economy. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the top 15 countries (DAC and non-DAC members) giving the highest amounts (in absolute terms) in 2015 are as follows (in billions of US dollars):
  - European Union: 87.64
  - United States: 31.08
  - United Kingdom: 18.7
  - Germany: 17.78
  - Japan: 9.32
  - France: 9.23
  - Sweden: 7.09
  - Netherlands: 5.81
  - United Arab Emirates: 4.39 (non DAC member)
  - Canada: 4.29
  - Norway: 4.28
  - Turkey: 3.91 (non DAC member)
  - Italy: 3.84
  - Switzerland: 3.54
  - Australia: 3.22
  - Denmark: 2.57


**Donor countries by percentage of gross national income** (GNI)

The OECD also lists countries by the amount of ODA they give *as a percentage of their gross national income*. Seven countries met the longstanding UN target for an ODA/GNI ratio of 0.7% in 2015. The top 15 DAC and non-DAC countries for 2015 are shown below:

- Sweden — 1.40%
- United Arab Emirates — 1.09% (non-DAC member)
- Norway - 1.05%
- Luxembourg — 0.93%
- Denmark — 0.85%
- Netherlands — O. 76%
- United Kingdom — 0.71%
- Finland — 0.56%
- Turkey — 0.54% (non-DAC member)
- Switzerland — 0.52%
- Germany — 0.52%
- I Belgium - 0.42%
- I France - 0.37%
- Ireland - 0.36%
- Austria — 0.32%

Aid recipients

- World Bank reports that Iraq was the top recipient of development aid in 2005 followed by Nigeria. However, this is due to the significant debt relief deals that were granted to these nations that year - when donor countries write off a portion of a recipient country's debt, it is counted as official development assistance from the donor country.
- The OECD reports that in 2009 Africa received the largest amount of ODA, at $\text{\textdollar}$28 billion. Of that, $\text{\textdollar}$25 billion went to countries south of the Sahara, with Sudan receiving approximately $\text{\textdollar}$1.9 billion and Ethiopia getting $\text{\textdollar}$1.8 billion. Asia received the second largest amount at $\text{\textdollar}$24 billion. The top ODA receiving countries in order were Afghanistan ($\text{\textdollar}$5.1 billion), Iraq ($\text{\textdollar}$2.6 billion) and Vietnam ($\text{\textdollar}$2.1 billion)

Criticism

- Official development assistance has been criticized by several economists for being an inappropriate way of helping poor countries. The Hungarian economist Peter Thomas Bauer has been one of the most vocal of them. Another notable economist arguing against ODA includes Dambisa Moyo in her book Dead Aid. According to her, a country used to receiving ODA may be perpetually bound to depend on **handouts**.
- Donor countries are most commonly compared by the amount of Official Development Assistance given and their quantity of aid as a percent of GDP. However, there is an increasing focus placed on the quality of aid, rather than simply the quantity. The Commitment to Development Index is one such measure that ranks the largest donors on a broad range of their "development friendly" policies. It takes into account the quality of aid, in addition to the quantity, penalizing countries for tied aid. Aid also does not operate in a vacuum; a country's policies on issues such as trade or migration also have a significant impact on developing countries.

# 7. Service sector project
**Agricultural Services Sector Project**

- The Agricultural Services Sector Project addresses two main goals of the Government's new agricultural sector policy: improvement of cost-effectiveness of public expenditures in the agricultural sector and improvement of nutritional standards and incomes in rural areas. The project is a hybrid operation composed of a policy component and an investment component.
- The policy component focuses on:
  1. reforming the agricultural input policy.
  2. reorganization of Buyenzi and Kirimiro Regional Development Companies (RDC).
  3. reforming the salary structure of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MOAL) staff.
- The investment component comprises:
  1. strengthening of MOAL's central services.
  2. strengthening agricultural research.
  3. strengthening through reorganization of regional agricultural services.
  4. management of RDC reorganization.
  5. promotion of community development and rural youth employment.
  6. strengthening of the cooperative movement.
  7. Scientific research project\
    Application of Scientific method to the investigation of relationships among natural phenomenon to solve a technical problem.
  8. Environment-friendly projects\
    Green - chemistry

# 8. According to scale and size
1. <c-blue>Mega project</c-blue>: A project involving huge investment and of relatively long duration (5 to 10 years) is called mega project. These projects require EIA. Example- Upper Karnali hydropower project.
2. <c-blue>Major project</c-blue>: It is smaller in size and also less complex than the mega project. Example- Middle Marshyangdi hydropower project.
3. <c-blue>Medium project</c-blue>: It is small in size than the major project. Examples- Khimti hydropower project. This project requires IEE (Initial Environmental Examination).
4. <c-blue>Small project</c-blue>: It is the smallest project in size and also of short duration. Example: Manang hydropower.
5. <c-blue>Micro project</c-blue>: It is smaller than the small project and managed by community-based organizations. Example: Ghandruk micro hydropower project.

# 9. According to time frame and speed
1. <c-blue>Normal project</c-blue>: normal time allowed for project implementation.
2. <c-blue>Crash project</c-blue>: saving in time is achieved by spending extra resources in terms of money, materials and manpower.

# 10. According to nature
1. <c-blue>Simple project</c-blue>: Simple projects involve only one or a few people over a short time. Typically, simple projects will have few tasks dependent on other tasks, and will be relatively straightforward and easy to coordinate. Examples might be coordinating delivery of resources for a workshop session, implementing a small marketing plan, or delivering a simple software enhancement.
2. <c-blue>Complex project</c-blue>: Nearly all large and many small projects exhibit characteristics of complexity. Nevertheless projects of all sizes continue to be managed using linear thinking strategies based on project management traditions that go back to the building of the great pyramids in Egypt during the third millennium BCE, when societies and work-groups were arranged hierarchically. Much of the thinking dominating project management as it is currently practiced and taught is still founded upon control theories which were developed in the early modern period to deal with nineteenth- and twentieth-century industrialization and imperial expansion. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this. However, issues do arise when these ideas are applied unilaterally to all kinds of projects in all contexts.
3. <c-blue>Innovative</c-blue>: Innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term "innovation" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that "breaks into" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The opposite of innovation is ex-novation.
While a novel device is often described as an innovation, in economics, management science, and other fields of practice and analysis, innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in a way that they affect society. In industrial economics, innovations are created and found empirically from services to meet the growing consumer demand.
4. <c-blue>Emergency</c-blue>: Emergency project is the work the organization and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all humanitarian aspects of emergencies – preparedness, response, and recovery – in order to reduce the harmful effects of all hazards, including disasters.

# 11. According to orientation
1. <c-blue>Product oriented project</c-blue>: the focus is on the technical part of the project. Examples-building, road, hydropower.
2. <c-blue>Process oriented</c-blue>:no consideration is given to technical part. Examples- person focused training, repair of cement plant etc.
