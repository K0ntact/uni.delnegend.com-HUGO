{{<hint type="note" title="Solution">}}
- We have this formular to calculate the *SIR at point P*:
$$ SIR \approx \frac{1}{(\frac{D}{R}-1)^{-n}+(\frac{D}{R}+1)^{-n}+4(\frac{D}{R})^{-n}}$$

- We also have
$$D \triangleq \sqrt{3 \times C} \times R$$

{{<center>}}
C: number of clusters | R: radius | D: distance
{{</center>}}

- We have 3 clusters, so $C = 3$

$$\Rightarrow \frac{D}{R} = 3$$

- $g(d) = \dfrac{1}{d^3} \Rightarrow n = 3$

$$\Rightarrow SIR \approx \frac{1}{(3-1)^{-3}+(3+1)^{-3}+4(3)^{-3}} \approx 3.463$$

## 1.2
Calculate the worst-case uplink SIR assuming the co-channel interference is caused only by the closest interfering mobiles in radio cells a distance $D = 3.46 R$ away from the cell. Assume the simplest path-loss model $g(d) = \frac{1}{d^4}$

# Erlang-B formula and sizing a cell
## 2.1
Calculate the Erlang loads generated by a user, who makes a call attempt ervery 15 minutes. Each call lasts an average of 2 minutes.

## 2.2
Consider a mobile system supporting $832$ frequency channels and $\text{C} = 7$ reuse. Probability of call blocking $P_B \leq 1%$. A typical user makes 200-second-long calls once every 15 minutes on the average. Assume that users are uniformly distributed over the cell. In a rural region, the density of mobile terminals is two terminals per km2. Calculate the required cell radius if a hexagonal topology is assumed.
